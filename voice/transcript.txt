FULL TRANSCRIPT:
==================================================
It is now my distinct honor to invite the President of the United States of America, His Excellency, Donald J. Trump, to address the Knesset. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. It's a great honor. Nice place. Very nice place. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, esteemed members of the Knesset, and cherished citizens of Israel. We gather on a day of profound joy, of soaring hope. After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families. And it is glorious. 28 more precious loved ones are coming home at last to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. After so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace. A land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity. This is not only the end of a war, this is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God. It's the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region. I. I believe that so strongly this is the historic dawn of a new Middle East. Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change and change very much for the better, like the USA right now. It will be the golden age of Israel and the golden age of the Middle East. It's going to work together. If you think we settled eight wars in eight months, I'm now including this one, by the way, if that's okay. They may say, well, that was quick, because yesterday I was saying seven, but now I can say eight. The hostages are back. The hostages are back. We make the best weapons in the world, and we've got a lot of them. And we've given a lot to Israel, frankly. I mean, Bibi would call me so many times. Can you get me this weapon? That weapon? That weapon. Some of them I never heard of. Bibi and I made them. But we'd get them here, wouldn't we? And they are the best. They are the best. And you. But you used them well. It also takes people that know how to use them, and you obviously used them very well, but so many that Israel became strong and powerful, which ultimately led to peace for so many families across this land. It has been years since you've known a single day of true peace. But now, at last, not only for Israelis, but also for Palestinians and for many others. The long and painful nightmare is finally over. As the dust settles, the smoke fades, the debris is removed and the ashes clean from the air. The day that breaks on a region transformed, and a beautiful and much brighter future appears suddenly within your reach. This is now a very exciting time for Israel and for the entire Middle East. Because all across the Middle east, the forces of chaos, terror and ruin that have plagued the region for decades now stand weakened, isolated and totally defeated. A new coalition of proud and responsible nations is emerging. And because of us, the enemies of all civilization are in retreat. This man is a good man right here. These two men are good men right here. Hey, I have an idea. Mr. President. Why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon. Come on. By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know, but I happen to like this gentleman right over here. And it just seems to make so much sense, you know, whether we like it or not, this has been one of the greatest wartime presidents. This has been one of the greatest wartime presidents. And cigars and champagne. Who the hell cares about that? My friends, this is only a partialist, but it's enough to affirm what I've said time and again. Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the state of Israel has ever had in the White House. Thank you, everybody. Good luck. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sam. Ne. Sam.
